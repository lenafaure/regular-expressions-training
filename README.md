### Following [The Coding Train - Regular Expressions Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DG3kCDx53c&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YEypLuls7iidwHMdCM6o2w)

### Single characters
```
\d          ⟶ 0-9
\w          ⟶ A-Z a-z 0-9 ("word")
\W          ⟶ Anything that is not one of the characters searched by \w
\s          ⟶ whitespace
\S          ⟶ Anything that is not whitespace
.           ⟶ any character
```

### Quantifiers
```
*           ⟶ 0 or more 
.*          ⟶ wildcard (matches everything)
+           ⟶ 1 or more
?           ⟶ 0 or 1
{min, max}  ⟶ number of characters between min and max
{n}         ⟶ specific number of characters "n"
```

### Position
```
^           ⟶ start of the string/line
$           ⟶ end of the string/line
\b          ⟶ word boundary (finds a match at the beginning or end of a word)
```
